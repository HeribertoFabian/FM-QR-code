## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

This is my first project on Frontend Mentor. During this challenge I mainly learned how to use the platform, submit solutions, and structure my projects for future challenges. I also practiced basic HTML and CSS, incluiding the use of flexbox, variables, and Google Fonts integration.

I'm starting to build good habits for organizing my files, writing cleaner code, and following design specifications more carefully.

### Continued development

Since this is my first Frontend Mentor project, I want to continue improving my CSS layout skills, specially with Flexbox and CSS Grid. I also want to get more comfortable with responsive design, better use of semantic HTML, and writing cleaner, more maintainable code..

In the next challenges, I plan to practive more advanced layouts, component structure, and accessibility best practices.
